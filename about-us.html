                <p>Cookies make the perfect rainy afternoon treat. From gooey American chocolate chip cookies to melty
                    shortbread, we've got a biscuit selection to please everyone..</p>
                <br>

                <ol>
                    <p>An example showing how first-party cookies work</p>
                    <li>When you visit a website for the first time, you might see a banner pop up somewhere on the
                        page,
                        informing you that the website uses cookies. It usually explains that to continue using the
                        website, you
                        have to agree to the use of cookies. By clicking on “Accept,” this banner disappears. This is
                        down to
                        the first-party cookie, which was generated when the page was accessed. It stores the
                        information that
                        you have accepted the conditions. The banner won’t re-appear next time you visit this site.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>Next, the website may ask you which language you prefer. This setting will also be stored in the
                        cookie.
                        If the website has a log-in area, you must register in order to use it fully. To do this, create
                        an
                        account with your e-mail address and a secret password that you will use to log in from now on.
                        To
                        facilitate this process, the cookie stores your e-mail address (but not your password). This
                        means that
                        when you next visit the site, you only need to enter your password because the site reads the
                        e-mail
                        address stored in the cookie.</li>
                    <br>
                    <li>The website has a large archive of information. To help you quickly find the pages you have
                        visited,
                        there is a small sidebar that links to the most recently visited subpages. This is also enabled
                        by the
                        cookie. Because all information in this example comes exclusively from this website, this text
                        file is a
                        first-party cookie. It is primarily intended to better your experience on the website. At the
                        same time,
                        the website operator receives valuable information on user behavior. </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>However, an unknown third party is still present: an advertising banner hosted by a third party
                        has
                        meanwhile placed its own cookie to store your usage data as well. This information is collected
                        by a
                        third party for web analytic purposes. From now on, they can follow your steps on the internet
                        if you
                        visit a site that has advertisements from this provider. Since this is from a third party, it is
                        referred to as a third-party cookie. The website operator has never informed you about this nor
                        asked
                        for your consent.</li>
