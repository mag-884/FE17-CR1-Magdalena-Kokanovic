        <p>Of all the summer salads, a classic chicken salad recipe is always a favorite
            at a picnic, a barbecue, or an office potluck! </p>
        <p>Just a few ingredients can be transformed into a cold,
            creamy salad or filling for a homemade chicken salad sandwich or wrap!</p>

        <h3>Chicken</h3>
        <br>

        <li>Use leftovers from last night’s dinner or leftover rotisserie chicken or grilled chicken.</li>
        <hr>
        <li>To Make Chicken for chicken salad I like to use either poached chicken or baked chicken breasts or thighs.
        </li>
        <hr>
        <li>You can use canned chicken in a pinch but of course fresh is best when possible.</li>
        <hr>
        <li>Ensure the chicken is cooled and shred or chop the chicken into bite sized pieces.</li>
        </ul>

        <br>
        <h3>Add-ins</h3>
        <br>
        <li>As this is a classic chicken salad recipe, I’ve kept the additions to a minimum. Celery for crunch, green
            onions for flavor.</li>
        <hr>
        <li>This recipe can be made with a variety of nuts, veggies, and fruit for added flavor and texture.</li>
        <hr>
        <li>Chicken salad with grapes, avocado or dried cranberries is a favorite. Pecans or almonds pair well with this
            recipe.
        </li>
        <br>

        <h3>Dressing</h3>
        <br>
        <li>Mayonnaise is the base of this recipe and it’s simply seasoned.</li>
        <hr>
        <li>You can get creative and substitute some of the mayo for ranch dressing or your favorite salad dressing
            recipe.</li>
        <hr>
        <li>Create an Avocado Chicken Salad by replacing some of the mayonnaise with mashed avocado.</li>
